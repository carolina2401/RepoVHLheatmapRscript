# RepoVHLheatmapRscript
A repository created to learn how to connect my GIT REPOSITORY "hypoVHL_localRep", that has the following files: 
(base) carolinasanabria@Carolinas-MacBook-Pro hypoVHL_localRep % ls
VHL_41progeny_MutCount.txt	dummyFILE.txt			purpose.txt  VHL_R_script_Heatmap.R		dummyFILE2.txt

... with this REMOTE GITHUB REPOSITORY "RepoVHLheatmapRscript".

I will then use python code to replicate the R Script that I used before to do a heatmap of the type of VHL mutations on different VHL phenotypes.
